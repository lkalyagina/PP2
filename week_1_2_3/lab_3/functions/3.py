Write a program to solve a classic puzzle: We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. 
How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have? create function: solve(numheads, numlegs)
'''
def solve(numheads, numlegs):
    rabbits = (numlegs-2*numheads)//2
    chickens = numheads-rabbits
    print (chickens, rabbits) 

solve(35,94)
